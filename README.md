# Comparative Analysis of FitzHugh-Nagumo and Hindmarsh-Rose Neural Models

## Introduction
In this project, we conducted a comparative analysis of the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) and Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) models to understand their effectiveness in modeling neuronal dynamics. Our work included simulating these models under various conditions, analyzing their responses to different stimuli, and evaluating their capabilities in replicating the complex behaviors observed in neurons. This practical approach allowed us to highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, offering insights into their applicability in computational neuroscience research.

## Technologies
This project utilizes Python 3.x, leveraging libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for visualization, and SciPy for advanced scientific computing.
